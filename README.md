# Alternative-Routes-In-Road-Networks
Alternative-Routes is a C++ project that explores efficient route planning in road networks. The goal is to find alternative routes that optimize travel time, considering real-time traffic conditions. This project leverages Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and incorporates collision avoidance techniques for a more realistic simulation.
